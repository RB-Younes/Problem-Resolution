# Problem Resolution Exercises Series

## Series of Practical Works No. 1: State Space Search

### Exercise 1:
1. **Description**:
   - Created a Python program that generates and displays an image containing a grid with elements representing either empty spaces or flowers of various colors, with one location designated as the target.
2. **Tasks Completed**:
   - Implemented algorithms for moving a robot towards the target using "breadth-first", "depth-first", and "uniform cost" approaches.
   - Conducted comparisons of the three algorithms for various configurations.

## Series of Practical Works No. 2: State Space Search

### Exercise 1: A* for Sliding Puzzle Game
1. **Description**:
   - Developed a Python program to create and display a 3x3 grid for a sliding puzzle game.
2. **Tasks Completed**:
   - Added functionality to allow moving numbers within the grid to solve the puzzle (java GUI).

   - Utilized the A* algorithm to find the optimal path for solving the puzzle.

## Series of Practical Works No. 3: MinMax Procedure and Alpha-Beta Pruning

### Exercise 1:
1. **Description**:
   - Implemented the MinMax procedure using Python.
2. **Tasks Completed**:
   - Applied the MinMax procedure to solve problems on example trees.

### Exercise 2:
1. **Description**:
   - Implemented the Alpha-Beta pruning technique using Python.
2. **Tasks Completed**:
   - Applied Alpha-Beta pruning to solve problems on example trees.

**Note**: Each series of exercises involved implementing specific algorithms and techniques related to problem resolution, primarily using Python.
